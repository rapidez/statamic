# Rapidez Statamic

This package helps you integrate Statamic within your Rapidez project by adding some good starting points:

- Products, categories and brands are integrated through [Runway](https://github.com/duncanmcclean/runway) as read only resources so you can link them to the content
- Products, categories and pages collections as starting point so you can extend this however you'd like
- Route merging so Statamic routes work as fallback
- Page builder fieldset with a product slider, content and image component
- Responsive images with [spatie/statamic-responsive-images](https://github.com/spatie/statamic-responsive-images)
- Breadcrumbs for pages
- Globals available in all views

## Requirements

You need to have `statamic/cms` installed in your Rapidez installation. Follow the [installation guide](https://statamic.dev/installing/laravel).

## Installation

```
composer require rapidez/statamic
```

## Configuration

Have a look within the `rapidez-statamic.php` config file, if you need to change something you can publish it with:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Rapidez\Statamic\RapidezStatamicServiceProvider" --tag=config
```

### Assets disk

Make sure there is an assets disk within `config/filesystems.php`
```
'disks' => [
    'assets' => [
        'driver' => 'local',
        'root' => public_path('assets'),
        'url' => '/assets',
        'visibility' => 'public',
    ],
],
```

### Routing

As Rapidez uses route fallbacks to allow routes to be added with lower priority than Magento routes, this package is used to fix this, as statamic routes on itself will overwrite your Magento routes. Make sure default Statamic routing is disabled in `config/statamic/routes.php`. We'll register the Statamic routes from this packages after the Magento routes.

```php
'enabled' => false,
```

#### Homepage

If you'd like to use the homepage from Statamic instead of the CMS page from Magento; just disable the homepage in Magento.

### Publish Collections, Blueprints and Fieldsets

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Rapidez\Statamic\RapidezStatamicServiceProvider" --tag=rapidez-statamic-content
```

And if you'd like to change the views:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Rapidez\Statamic\RapidezStatamicServiceProvider" --tag=views
```


### Magento Store ID

It is important to add the Magento store ID in the attributes section within `config/statamic/sites.php` for every site

```php
'sites' => [
    'default' => [
        'name' => config('app.name'),
        'locale' => 'nl_NL',
        'url' => '/',
        'attributes' => [
            'magento_store_id' => 1,
        ]
    ],
]
```

### Showing content on categories and products

By default you'll get the configured content on categories and products available withint the `$content` variable. This can be enabled/disabled with the `fetch` configurations within the `rapidez-statamic.php` config file. If you want to display the configured content from the default page builder you can include this in your view:
```
@includeWhen(isset($content), 'rapidez-statamic::page_builder', ['content' => $content?->content])
```
- Product: `resources/views/vendor/rapidez/product/overview.blade.php`
- Category: `resources/views/vendor/rapidez/category/overview.blade.php`
