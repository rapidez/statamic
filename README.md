# Rapidez Statamic

## Requirements

You have to have `statamic/cms` installed in your laravel application. Installation guide is found [here](https://statamic.dev/installing/laravel).

## Installation

```
composer require rapidez/statamic
```

### Routing

As Rapidez uses route fallbacks to allow routes to be added with lower priority then Magento routes, this package is used to fix this, as statamic routes on itself will overwrite your Magento routes. Make sure default Statamic routing is disabled in `config/statamic/routes.php`:

```php

'enabled' => false,

```

### Commands

There are 2 commands that trigger 2 seperate jobs. One is for importing the categories from Magento and the other is for importing the products from Magento.

#### Categories import

```
php artisan rapidez:statamic:sync:categories
```

#### Product import

```
php artisan rapidez:statamic:sync:products
```

### Publish

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Rapidez\Statamic\RapidezStatamicServiceProvider"
```

### Multisite

When configuring your multisite for Statamic in `config/statamic/sites.php`, it is important to add the Magento store ID in the attributes section.

```php
'sites' => [
    'default' => [
        'name' => config('app.name'),
        'locale' => 'nl_NL',
        'url' => '/',
        'attributes' => [
            'magento_store_id' => 1,
        ]
    ],
]
```
